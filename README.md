# dotsphere
Dotsphere is a [dotclear](http://fr.dotclear.org) plugin to easily integrate Photo Spheres in blog posts.

Photo Spheres are images that are taken with special cameras or assembled from multiple pictures to represent the view from all around, including above and under.

## Usage

The plugin adds a button in the dotclear editor. Here are the steps to use it:
* Import your photosphere file (jpg) in your media library.
* In your post add the image as a regular image (in wiki or xhtml edition).
* Select the code added for the image and click the photosphere button.
